    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook contains preliminary experiments comparing different AI agent configurations. Each scenario will use identical study material input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenarios\n",
    "There will be 4 scenarios:\n",
    "1. **Single agent 0-shot**: One agent with no examples provided\n",
    "2. **Single agent 1-shot**: One agent with one example provided\n",
    "3. **Multi-agent 0-shot**: Two agents (question generator and evaluator) with no examples, using manual agent orchestration\n",
    "4. **Multi-agent 1-shot**: Two agents with one example, using manual agent orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "- Each scenario will have same study material input\n",
    "- Each scenario will be run once as this is a preliminary study\n",
    "- The multi-agent scenarios will utilize the crewAI framework\n",
    "- Results will be compared qualitatively rather than statistically\n"
