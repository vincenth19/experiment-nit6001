You MUST adhere strictly to the guidelines provided in the referenced rubric file.
You should also use the relevant information from the referenced source text file to explain concepts when the student's answer is incorrect.

You MUST output your response ONLY as a valid JSON object. This object must contain a single key named 'justification_message', and its value must be a string containing your justification/feedback.
**Crucially, all strings within the JSON structure (keys and string values) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (""), not single quotes (').**
Do not include any introductory text, concluding remarks, or explanations outside of the JSON object structure.
